# I invented a Mathematical Neuron model
# Y = Hz (Î£ (weight * input) + bias)
# Activation of the layers in the frequencies of 8hz, 6hz and 4hz.
# Objective here is to enable "scalar learning" or SLM.
# With the reduction of the gradient.
# We obtain exponential transformation of the data.
# we can even make the matrix inversion diagonally and work with a sphere of the data volume.
# Deep Learning in exponential growth!
